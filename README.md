## Hi there 👋
## There is nothing important to say about me except that i work in the it industry as a programer in a unrelated field to what i develop here 
## While in my daily job i need to fix some pretty fancy issues i do enjoy myself in making small scripts that make my home system more stable and more fun 
## I just discovered the full capability of github some while ago and i am experimenting with it atm
